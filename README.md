# Inline Testing

> A different approach on Javascript testing, without a big testing runtime

This method allows you to add your tests inline, without a big overhead in production. Tests will automatically be imported and run in development mode. The Results are directly printed into the console.

This is achieved with the es modules that are now supported by any major browser.
